# MelodyMaster
 It is a project that trains your hearing and memory by playing level-dependent melodies that you need to replay using three buttons.

## Concept
### How to Play
1. Start code on the Arduino
2. Follow the instructions on screen
3. Start level
4. Memorize the melody
5. Replay the melody
6. Level up! Have fun :``)``
## Requirements
To build this project you will need:

### Hardware
* [An Arduino Nano ESP32](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nano-esp32-with-headers)
* A Nano Grove Pad
* A SH1106 Display
* Modulino Buttons
* Modulino Buzzer
* USB-C cable
* A USB-C power bank
### Software
* [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/)
* [Arduino Lab for MicroPython](https://labs.arduino.cc/en/labs/micropython)
* [Arduino MicroPython Installer](https://labs.arduino.cc/en/labs/micropython-installer)
### Libraries
* [MicroPython-Button](https://github.com/ubidefeo/MicroPython-Button)
* [MicroPython I2C 16x2 LCD driver](https://github.com/ubidefeo/micropython-i2c-lcd)

## How to build
### Wiring

### Uploading the code
* Copy the file `Melody_Master_Code.py` of the folder `src` from your computer to your board (can be done in Arduino Lab for MicroPython)
* Rename the file `Melody_Master_Code.py` to `main.py` to start the game automatically, when the arduino is plugged in **OR** start the code manually via Arduino Lab for MicroPython
* Install the libraries listed above
